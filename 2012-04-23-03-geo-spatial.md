### Setting a Rails app with Geospatial

#### Libraries needed

* libgoes - goemetric algorithms
* libproj - coordinate projections
* PostGIS - spatial plugin for Progres
* RGeo - Ruby libraries

#### Gems needed

* activerecord-postgis-adapter
* rgeo-shapefil
* sequeel https://github.com/ernie/squeel

### Project 1 Visiulizing location activity

* Using Mercator projection instead of lat/lon, easier to query
* Visualation using heat maps rather pushpins, heatmap.js thermo.js


### Project 2 Timezones based on location

### Ideas for projects

* Heatmap to see where student/leads are located and rendered and filtered with JS
* Heetmap with website traffic from Google Anaytics using IPs
