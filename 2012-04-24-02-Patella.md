# Monday Session 1: Patella: It's Memoization into Memcached calculated in the background with Resque

## Presenter: Jeff Dwyer

### Ax to Grid

* Engineer is often seen as the *brake* in innovation
* Make innovation easy in getting something out there then scale it

### The problem

* Match clinical trials and patient data with Geolocation
* What's the right coach
  * PostGIS
  * MongoDB
* What's easy - huge SQL query
* Who know if location is important?
* Is the project important?
* Using a new tech like MongoDB requires more setup and hard to kill the experiment

### Patient Like Me

* Patient Ranking
* Basic search with huge amount of data
* Good looking code and SQL, but took too long and would bring site with heavy usuage
* As an engineer I would to say we can build a forward looking time machine, not the brake

### Steping Back

* Relational data is best queried in a relational database
* Relational don't scale well
* Want to experiement easily and succeed or fail fast

### What we want

* Easy way to declare slow methods
* Framework for calling these methods

### Solution

* Doing it right is too slow
* Memoization
  * Built in Rails for SQL queries
* Memcached
  * Simple to setup
  * First request still hit the server hard
  * Slow methods can't be in the request response cycle
* Remove constraints
  * Guarantee perfomance
  * Don't guarantee a result

### Technology

* Memoization
* Memcached
* Resque - don't process in request cycle
* Send later
  * Easy way to create worker that just calls a method in the models

### Pattella

* Run later
  * Mixin to send method to worker
* Memoization
  * Return what the method result had with an additional `loading?` method
  * Metta programming to build cache methods build methods
* Memchached
  * Avoid Dog Pile with promise so you only fire off one worker
  * Soft expiration so result recalculates if it's stale, but not expired
  * Always put JSON in memchached

### Take aways

* Look at ways we can use caches for Student data or at least analyze usage
