# Tuesday Morning Keynote: Failure

## Presenter: Aaron Patterson

### Failure to Remember

* Tokido
  * Benefits
    * Students
    * Teachers
    * All Developers
  * Ecosystem
* How important is your time?

### Failure to evolve

* Concurrency
* Producer Consumer Pattern
* The interface is the Most Important
* Implementatiom is Secondary

### Failure to lead

* Fear of features
* Lower Tolerance to Technical Debt
* Value = Current + Potential
* Cost = Dev Time + Maintenance
* Tolerance = Value / Cost
* New developers are more likely to click the merge button
* Types of features
  * Cosmetic
    * Dubious value and unknown debt
    * Example: Tagged Logging
  * Refactoring
    * High value and low debt
    * Example: Notification
  * Course Correcting
    * High value and unknown debt
    * Example: Asset Pipeline
    * Computation Distribution
      * Server and Terminal -> Distributed PC
      * Centralize Web -> Distributed Processing with JS + Browser
    * There is no bail out for technical debt
* We need to be prepared

### Take aways

* Evaluate Value and Cost of new features
