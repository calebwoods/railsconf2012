## Progress
It's what's keep me interested - DHH

"It's great that we've move on from COBOL"

### How much do you *really* like progress

* REST
* Ruby 1.9
* Bundler
* Rails 3
* Asset Pipeline
* Coffee Script

### What do I get for this progress?

* The old one was better
* Not all forward movement is progress

### Skepticism is OK

* we need to evaluate new ideas
* Curious vs Suspicious

### Most people start out as curious and then something happens

* Everybody like the cutting edge until they cut themselves
* "If it ain't broke don't fix it"
* You develop a learned reation to failure and consiquences of it

### Growing old

* Mental pattern in thinking old
* When young change is easy - it's easy to experiment
* Mr. Mature has something lose based on what he knows
* When you have nice things you don't want to lose them "Don't rock the boat"
* In life growing old takes 30 years, in tech 3-5 years

### Curious to Suspicious is a one way street

* How can we postpone this whether an event or growing old
* Loss aversion is the pillar of conservatism
* Won't somebody please think of the newbies?
* People want to turn technology into an Easy Bake
* Progress can be frustrating it's supposed to be you are learning a real skill
* There is no speed limit to learning
* If people set high expectations that's where people strive, if you set low expectations that's where people live down to

### Loss aversion

* People hate losing more than they like gaining
* We can hack our brain, we don't know *yet*, not that we don't know
* Great products are made by people who use them

### Progress hurts

* It hurts a lot less if you just accept it
* Rails 4 will change things, break things
* Stay young, stau curious, stay hippy
